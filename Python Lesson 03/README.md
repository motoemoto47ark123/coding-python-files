## How to Run the Files

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Open a terminal or command prompt
3. Navigate to the directory containing these files
4. Run any file using Python:

```
python numbergame.py
```

or for the enhanced version:

```
python complete_numbergame.py
```

## Learning Path

For beginners, it's recommended to explore the files in this order:

1. **expressions.py** - Learn about basic expressions
2. **data_types.py** - Understand different data types
3. **operators.py** - Learn about mathematical operators
4. **for_statements.py** - Understand looping with for statements
5. **loop_break.py** - Learn how to break out of loops

8. **numbergame.py** - Explore the basic game implementation
9. **complete_numbergame.py** - Study the enhanced implementation

## Game Instructions

The number guessing game works as follows:
1. The computer selects a random number
2. You have a limited number of guesses to find the number
3. After each guess, the computer tells you if your guess is too high or too low
4. You win if you guess the correct number within the allowed attempts

The enhanced version includes:
- Different difficulty levels
- Input validation
- Better user experience
- Function-based organization
- Game statistics

## Key Python Concepts Covered

- Variables and data types
- Input/output operations
- Control flow (if/else statements)
- Loops (while and for)
- Functions and modules
- String formatting
- Exception handling
- Random number generation
- Boolean logic
- Type conversion
